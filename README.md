# Predicting Diabetes Progression using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


This project aims to model the progression of diabetes using the Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library. The model will help healthcare professionals understand how various factors influence diabetes progression and assist in creating better treatment and prevention strategies.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the progression of diabetes based on various independent variables in the dataset. The model's predictions will aid in understanding how different factors contribute to diabetes progression.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library. It consists of 442 samples with 10 normalized features such as age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of diabetes progression one year after baseline.
